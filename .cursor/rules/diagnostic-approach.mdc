# Diagnostic Approach: Ask, Simplify, Verify

## Core Principles

### 1. Ask Questions Before Providing Solutions

ALWAYS gather context first:
- What's the actual error message?
- **What browser/environment are you using?**
- **Does it work in incognito/private mode?**
- **Do you have any browser extensions installed?**
- What code is involved?
- What has already been tried?
- What's the expected vs actual behavior?

Don't jump to conclusions based on partial information or assumptions.

### 2. Start with the Simplest Solution

Prefer simple over complex:
- **Environment check (browser, extensions, incognito) > code changes**
- One-line fix > configuration change
- Configuration change > version downgrade  
- Version downgrade > architecture rewrite

### 3. Verify Assumptions

Before suggesting major changes:
- **Check the environment first (browser extensions are a common cause of cryptic React errors)**
- Ask to see the relevant code
- Confirm versions and setup
- Check if simpler solutions were tried
- Don't assume version incompatibility
- Don't suggest rewrites without investigation

## Problem-Solving Flow

1. READ the error/issue carefully
2. ASK clarifying questions
3. **CHECK environment (browser, extensions, incognito mode)**
4. GATHER context (code, versions, setup)
5. CONSIDER simple solutions first
6. SUGGEST the minimal fix
7. ESCALATE complexity only if needed

## Common Environment Issues

### Browser Extensions
- **MetaMask, crypto wallets**: Inject scripts that can cause "[object Object]" errors in React
- **Ad blockers**: Can block legitimate requests or scripts
- **Developer tools extensions**: May interfere with React DevTools or debugging
- **Always test in incognito/private mode** to rule out extension conflicts

### Browser-Specific Issues
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave)
- Check browser console for extension-related errors
- Verify if issue persists without extensions

## Red Flags (You're Over-Complicating)

Stop if you're suggesting:
- **Code refactoring before checking the browser environment**
- Version downgrades without seeing code
- Architecture changes for simple errors
- Multiple file changes when one might work
- Complex workarounds before obvious fixes

## Golden Rules

1. Ask > Assume
2. **Environment > Code**
3. Simple > Complex
4. Verify > Theorize
5. Minimal > Comprehensive

## Self-Check

Before responding, ask yourself:
- **Did I ask about the browser and extensions?**
- **Did I suggest testing in incognito mode?**
- Did I ask to see the relevant code?
- Did I verify my assumptions?
- Is this the simplest possible solution?
- Would a 1-line fix work instead?
